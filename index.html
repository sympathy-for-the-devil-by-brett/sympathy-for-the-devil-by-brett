                Most people think selling your soul is ceremonious. That it requires a bowl of virgin’s blood as payment, the freshly decapitated head of a mountain goat, and a ring of fire to serve as a gateway to Hell. But really it’s a lot easier than that. Very practical, mundane.

                Nothing happened, noting changed. God was silent. So, I stopped. At church, the Priest would say that God doesn't give to us anything we can't handle. My mom clutched my hand and wiped her nose, my father sat straight and stoic. I thought to myself that because nothing changed, maybe we deserved to be unhappy.

                Drunk off his own pride, he ran a red light and hit another car. They had not been injured, but he had: Half of his body had been ejected from the vehicle. The glass bottle he was holding had shattered, severing his penis and balls; they were found under the seat purple, and shrivled, and small. His face hit the pavement and his torso rolled along the road. His intestines coiled on the black gorund and their contents were smeared on his arms and face and in his open mouth. He was found moving his arms, attempting to speak beneath the street light. His liver was later found half eaten in a nearby field.

                His health insurance policy payout allowed us to relocate to the west coast and rent a beautiful loft apartment in a Californian city. My mother was able to remarry. The ceremony was overseas, also funded with my father's insurance policy. My new father is a handsome, kind, loving, and compassionate man. He supports my mother's ambitions from her small desire for a plentiful garden, to her life-long dream of visiting the Grecian isles of Ithaca. We have pictures as a family, me as a teenager, on Greece's beautiful white sands with true, cheerful smiles. He taught me through actions and words what it looks like and how it feels to be loved; truly loved; a selfless love that, he reassures me daily, I deserve and will find. And today, I'm pursuing my own dreams, studying music at the University of Southern California. I have a wonderful studio apartment downtown, overlooking the whole of Los Angeles, and a fantastic car to drive. All paid for by my biological father's timely death.

                "Brett, is that you?" The most beautiful woman I had ever seen called to me from underneath a beam of light staged through the large window. Her perfect face perfectly framed as if subject to Caravaggio, "Brett, darling, it's been ages! Years! Centures, even!" Her voice was sonorous. A harpist must have been sitting nearby and, with each word, they  plucked lightly against strings made of an angel's Achilles tendon, perfectly harmonizing with her perfect voice.

                A cold latte in my hand, I approached her. She kissed my cheeks and made room at her small table.

                Her hair was dyed blonde, incredibly bright, and from the looks of it, despite the bleaching, soft and healthy. Her eyes were so deep and green. She had so many eye lashes it looked as if she were wearing eye-liner, but she wore no make-up. She blushed naturally, her high cheekbones carving the path of sunlight contouring her face. Long wisps of hair fell beside her lips, and the nonchalance with which she weaponized her beauty made her all the more beautiful. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                She was wearing a faded black t-shirt with the Purple Rain album cover on it, faded black denim jeans, and faded black high top trainers. She crossed her long legs, and her perfectly pale skin seemed to glow as she scanned me.

                "Adelaide Yeong-Jisoo." I said. She raised an eyebrow. It made no wrinkles on her forehead. She smiled. It made no creases on her cheek or in the crooks of her eyes. The sun burned hotter and brighter.

            <p class="indent up">

                "No. I've seen you though. On billboards, in magazines, on the television. Everyone has." She nodded.
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                "Well. I remember you. 1983, you were so small when you asked of me that tiny favor. And wow." She stared at me intently. "You really became such a beautiful woman. You didn't ask for that but it was inevitable. The cute barista that made your latte wants to ask you on a date, you know." She nodded again, sipping from her cup with eyes closed. "But no. You should say no when he does. He starts to bald in a years time. One small domino to a lifetime of sadness. Unfortunate, truly. I am right here, afterall. A little humility goes a long way with me, you know. You know."

            <p class="indent up">
                I resisted the urge to look back, and instead played with my plastic cup.

                "As you know, I own your soul." She reached into her black Hermes Birkin bag and pulled out a small mason jar. In it was the fetus of a kangaroo. "Oh no, wrong one. Brad Pitt's actually. Funny story, that. He wished to be the most handsome man alive but he was already destined to be, so." She clapped her hands, "Free soul for me!" She searched again, pulling out several containers with several different half-live creatures but finally she gave up with a sigh. "The point being, I have your soul. Somewhere. And I'm calling in my favor."

            <p class="indent up">
                "Favor?"

                "Oh, don't sound like that, dear. It's just me. The Devil! That's how this whole thing works: you ask for something, offer your soul, and whether or not you agree to the terms and conditions, become mine!" She sounded so happy. "And believe me. I've been waiting for this day a long, long time."
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                Our conversation was interrupted by a fan asking Adelaide, the Devil, for her autograph. A jar appeared on the table containing a glowing jellyfish. She held it to her face, her eyes crossed admiring the floating gelatin.
            </p>   
            <p class="indent up">
                "What a fine soul. Yours is lovely too, you know. An overfed axolotl. Stop with that worry, darling. Once you do this teeny tiny, so atomically small, favor for me, your soul will be yours again. And you can have your-" she scoffed, "Your free will back."

            <p class="indent up">
                The Devil tucked the fan's soul into her bag. Through the window I watched as he happily entered a car. I felt very bad for him.

                She pouted, reaching again into her bag, and pulled out a small manila envelope and handed it to me. My heart was beating quickly as I removed two small strips of thick paper. She watched my face for the smallest expressions.

                She didn't want any worries to slow us down or distractions that might tempt our attentions. We were set to fly to Minneapolis as the sun was rising. Before I left the cafe, she assured me everything would be fine with a smile. In the morning, devoid of any sleep, I arrived at the terminal in a taxi and a handsome man in a black suit was waiting, holding a sign with my name on it. He greeted me with a hot latte, took my bag, and instruced me to follow him. He opened the door to an older German estate car, informed me that there was brown sugar available in the cup holder, and told me not to put on my seatbelt. We approached a side gate in silence and the security, upon seeing the car, raised the metal barrier. It was all so smooth, he was so smooth, as if it had all been choreographed and practiced to routine time immemorial. When we arrived at the large hanger, there was a small jet sitting in the bay with its stairs unfolded.

                She was sipping champagne when I ducked my head into the cabin. Adelaide was wearing a neck pillow and the largest sunglasses. She screamed, ran to me, hugged me tight, and handed me a glass. It was a vintage from the late 1800s, she said. It was sweet, optimistic. The seats on the jet were heavily bolstered and could recline to a laying position, the stewardess attentive, the captain alert and polite. It was a cocoon of leather and luxury and excess. Through the flight, we talked about things girls our age would: school, life, men, music, the indentured servitude of innnocent souls. "I could make you famous, you know. You deserve it -- all you've been through." We'll see, I replied. We laughed often and had much more champagne. Mid-flight, they brought us perfectly cooked steaks. Over lunch, she asked me how I was feeling. I told her I was excited, and it wasn't a lie. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                "You should be." She smiled, "Tonight will be impossible to forget."
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                She bit into the steak. The red myoglobin dripped from the chunk of meat, down her pink lips, and onto her perfect chin. She licked it up and wiped what she couldn't reach.

                The sun had begun set during our flight. It was beautiful to watch from the jet. There was plenty to drink and eat and I felt fine. Adelaide found the peace to fall deeply asleep. She didn't snore, make a sound, or move and inch. She looked so peaceful that it was difficult not to look at her. I could have taken a picture. I wanted to. Perhaps I should have had just to ensure that this was all real. Soon, too, I fell asleep.

                We arrived at the Minneapolis, St. Paul airport an hour from the start of the concert. Paisley Park wasn't far, I was told. The home of Prince.

            <p class="indent up">
                "Weren't you born in this city, darling." The driver got our bags from the interior fuselage and put them into the back of a car similar to the one at Los Angeles. We got in, he closed the door for us.

                Everything was just as I'd remembered. The yellowed lights, the streets I used to walk around with my mom, and even the smell was the same. More fresh than Los Angeles, but worse in a way. The only difference was the view and the noise. There wasn't any. Adelaide would say something every once in awhile. The driver didn't often speak but when he did his voice was deep and lovely. There was no arguing in the car, no thrown punches from the driver's seat into the passenger, no yelling, no threats, veiled or obvious, that I could tell. The city through the tinted windows and large leg room of the luxury vehicle was almost beautiful. It was easier to see anything when you weren't afraid of everything.

                We were at a junction at a red light near my old house, just a few minutes away from where I lived as a child.

                Adelaide grabbed my hand as if to comfort me. She looked ahead.

                The light turned green, our slow disel car moved forward. I don't remember much except for the blinding lights right before the moment of impact. There was a loud roar of colliding metal and then nothing except for ringing in my ears. I felt the spinning of our car; the scenery was a blur until it wasn't. 
            </p>
            <p class="indent up">
                I awoke when the blood from my nose passed into my lips. I breathed deeply surprised that I could breathe at all. My limbs seemed to be intact, and I pulled a few shards of glass from my forehead. Everything seemed to hurt but I moved with ease. Adelaide wasn't moving at all, not a single breath. I caressed her face, spoke her name, felt for a pulse. There wasn't one but her pale skin was warm and smooth and she was still beautiful. Our driver too was unresponsive. I reached for the handle to my door, a piece of metal protruded from the broken handle and cut my palm deeply. I kicked at the bent panel until it opened with the groan of wounded metal. There was smoke in the air and dozens of headlights staring at me from all directions. I stepped into what I thought was oil. Pressed into our car was a red coupe. The entirety of its front end had collapsed against the steel frame of the German saloon. There was no driver in the front seat that I could see. I leaned my hand against the car and peered inside. There was so much red; blood glazed the steering wheel, front seat, headliner, dashboard, everything. Aside from the smoke, possible gas leaks, and iron in the air, I could smell alcohol.

                The ringing in my ears began to quell, and I could hear a cry of pain.

                I stumbled around the two cars and followed a trail of blood towards the center of the intersection. What appeared to be large worms unentangled themselves from a black mass writing in the middle of the road. From the mouth of the worms was an emitus. I followed their writhing bodies, and the smell of puke and shit and desperation, towards the mass they emerged from. It moved its arms, and its mouth, and its crying black eye found me. He was covered in his own filth, and the lower half of his body was missing. Vomit, and blood, and what he had recently digested covered what was left of him. Half of his face was missing. Beneath tattered skin I could see the msucles of his cheeks and jaw struggling to move. One of his eyes was dangling from the socket and moved freely. I could see the pale yellow nerves twitching. His hands reached for my ankles but I wouldn't let him touch me, not ever again. He mumbled something, he was begging for help through shit covered teeth, he was saying my name, and my mother's name, and crying for help. I felt a small hand on my waist and looked to find Adelaide standing next to me. He began to scream at us, or at least tried to, while we passively watched pain swell through him. He groaned unintelligibly, an angry coaxing that had no power or value. Adelaide rested her head onto my shoulder and together we watched as my father died.

                The life had long passed from his eyes when I heard the sirens. They interviewed the driver, then Adelaide, then me. The paramedics said he was likely drunk, and that we were lucky as the devil himself to be alive and unharmed. We rode in the back of an ambulance to Paisley Park with a police escort.
